# Airport-Navigation-System-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-
This is a Medium level Data Structures & Algorithms project that is built on Python fundamentals. 
It revolves around finding the shortest path between different places within an Airport.
We enhance the system with the help of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Dijkstra's Algorithm works on the basic principle of finding the shortest path from the source to the destination by reducing the time and space complexity.
In this project, we do not make use of backtracking to find the shortest path which makes it less complicated to figure out in the least amount of time.
