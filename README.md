# Airport-Navigation-System-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-
This is a Medium level Data Structures &amp; Algorithms project that is built on Python fundamentals. It revolves around finding the shortest path between different places within an Airport. We enhance the system with the help of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
